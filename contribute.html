                MRISC32 is an open source project. If you wish to get involved,
                have a look below for things that we would like to get help
                with.
            </p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
                An "MRISC32" logo is missing. Any help with designing a suitable
                logo would be appreciated.
            </p>

            <h3>Toolchains</h3>
            <p>
                Currently there is no high level language support for MRISC32.
                LLVM and GCC back ends need to be implemented. Roughly speaking,
                the following is the priority order for MRISC32 support:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Basic scalar integer ISA support (i.e. the minimal subset of the MRISC32 ISA)</li>
                <li>Floating point support (32-bit is supported in hardware, 64-bit requires software emulation)</li>
                <li>Vector support (through intrinsics and/or autovectorization)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>MRISC32-A1 device compatibility</h3>
            <p>
                During the development of MRISC32-A1, the main target device has
                been an Intel Cyclone V FPGA. The VHDL source code is written in
                a portable way, so it should synthesize against any target device -
                in theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be good to get some help with testing the design on
                more devices (e.g. Xilinx, Lattice and Microsemi devices). Just
                running the code through synthesis, fitting and timing would give
                a good indication about the level of device support.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would also be interesting to know how the design performs (e.g.
                what FMAX to expect) on high end devices (e.g. Intel Stratix and
                Xilinx Virtex), for which there is no support from free software
                tools.
