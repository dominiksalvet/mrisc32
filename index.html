        <h1>MRISC32 - A 32-bit RISC/Vector CPU</h1>

        <h2>Mostly harmless Reduced Instruction Set Computer, 32-bit edition</h2>

        <b>MRISC32 is an experimental, custom 32-bit RISC/Vector CPU, primarily
        inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">Cray-1</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS</a>
        architectures. The focus is to create a clean, modern ISA that is equally
        attractive to software, hardware and compiler developers.</b>
