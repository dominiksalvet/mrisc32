        <h1>MRISC32: An open 32-bit RISC/Vector ISA</h2>
        <p>
            MRISC32, short for "Mostly harmless Reduced Instruction Set Computer, 32-bit edition",
            is a 32-bit RISC/Vector instruction set architecture
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">ISA</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The focus is to create a clean, modern ISA that is equally attractive to software,
            hardware and compiler developers. Another key goal is to enable high performance
            implementations, with good scalar and vector integer, floating point and fixed point
            support.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ISA is primarily inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">Cray-1</a>
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS</a> architectures,
            and is further influenced by the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V">RISC-V</a>
            architecture (in particular "<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/papers/EECS-2016-1.pdf">Design of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture</a>"
            by Andrew Waterman).
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Unified scalar/vector/integer/floating point ISA</li>
            <li>Load/store architecture</li>
            <li>Two register files:
                <ul>
                    <li>32 scalar registers (s0-s31)</li>
                    <li>32 vector registers (v0-v31)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Easily decoded fixed size 32 bits wide instruction words</li>
            <li>Branches are based on register content
                <ul>
                    <li>There is no special condition code register</li>
                    <li>Compare instructions generate bit masks that can be used by branch instructions as well as for masking and other purposes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dynamic and future proof vector model:
                <ul>
                    <li>Most instructions can operate on both scalar and vector registers</li>
                    <li>Vector operation lengths are variable on a per-instruction basis</li>
                    <li>The vector register size is implementation defined in a binary compatible fashion</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>8-bit and 16-bit data types can be packed in 32-bit chunks
                <ul>
                    <li>Most instructions (integer and floating point alike) offer increased parallelism for packed data types:

                    <li>Scaled indexed load/store addressing (register + scale * register)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implementations</h2>
        <p>
            The first implementation of the MRISC32 ISA is <a href="https://github.com/mbitsnbites/mrisc32/tree/master/hw/mrisc32-a1">MRISC32-A1</a>,
            which is a soft processor implemented in VHDL. It is a single issue, in order
            architecture, and it implements the entire MRISC32 ISA.
        </p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
            Current documentation and the MRISC32-A1 VHDL code is availaböe
            at the GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/mbitsnbites/mrisc32">mbitsnbites/mrisc32</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The blog post "<a href="https://www.bitsnbites.eu/the-mrisc32-a-vector-first-cpu-design/">"The MRISC32 – A vector first CPU design</a>"
            gives some information regarding the architectural features of the MRISC32 ISA.
        </p>

        <h2>Status</h2>
        <p>
            The MRSIC32 ISA and the MRISC32-A1 implementation is still in development.
            Several aspects such as exception handling and memory management are still
            undefined.
